            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>dinnertable: A 20-Seat Speakeasy-Style Restaurant</h1><p>The sign beside the interior door reads "Press for Food." If you're in front of it, you've just walked through the bustling East Village cocktail bar The Garret East, beyond a curtain, into a petite corridor.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Light painting with pixelstick</h1><p>More info at thepixelstick.com! We spent the last year building pixelstick, a light painting tool capable of everything from photo-real renders to amazing abstract ribbons. We've improved with every iteration and are excited to finally show off what it can do. Everything was shot by just two slightly sleep deprived guys and one Pixelstick in Brooklyn.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f83450408b8ae969aa617e22dc894484/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F481060213_1280x720.jpg"></article>]]></description>
